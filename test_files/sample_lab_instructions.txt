# Lab Assignment: Fibonacci Sequence Implementation and Visualization

## Course Information
- **Course**: Introduction to Programming
- **Date**: Fall 2023
- **Instructor**: Dr. Jane Smith

## Objectives
1. Implement the Fibonacci sequence algorithm in Python
2. Understand recursive and iterative approaches to sequence generation
3. Visualize numerical data using matplotlib
4. Practice proper code documentation and commenting

## Background
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. It appears in many areas of mathematics and science, from the arrangement of leaves on a stem to the spiral of shells.

## Exercise 1: Fibonacci Implementation
Write a Python function that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term. Your implementation should:
- Handle edge cases (n â‰¤ 0, n = 1, n = 2)
- Use an efficient iterative approach
- Include proper documentation with function parameters and return values

## Exercise 2: Sequence Visualization
Create a function that visualizes the Fibonacci sequence using matplotlib. Your visualization should:
- Plot the sequence values against their indices
- Include appropriate labels and a title
- Use different visualization methods (e.g., line plot, bar chart)
- Format the plot for readability

## Submission Requirements
- Submit a single Python file containing your implementation
- Ensure your code runs without errors
- Include comments explaining your approach
- Attach screenshots of the generated visualizations

## Grading Criteria
- Correctness of implementation (40%)
- Quality of visualization (30%)
- Code style and documentation (20%)
- Handling of edge cases (10%)
